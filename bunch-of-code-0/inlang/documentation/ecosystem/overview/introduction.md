# What is inlang?

**inlang** is globalization infrastructure that powers an ecosystem of inlang apps, plugins and solutions that make globalization simple.

## Ecosystem Approach

For every use case, there is an app, a plugin, a lint rule, or a custom solution that can be built. Once you have set up your inlang project, you can use all of them without any additional effort.

## Using repositories as a backend

inlang apps are built on lix. Lix is a git-compatible version control backend for your software projects. Using lix provides inlang with CI/CD for globalization and collaboration between developers, translators, and designers on one common source of truth: **Your repository and your data**.

![change control with lix](https://github.com/opral/monorepo/assets/58360188/917cc987-669d-4203-a2ed-8184087fd070)

What you get with this approach:

- **Quality management** - Define [Lint Rules](/documentation/lint-rule) for your project to ship quality cross-app. 
- **Automations** - With lix change control you can use CI/CD to check lint, machine translate, validate and more. (Continuous Localization)
- **Review** - PR workflows can be used to gain control over the merged content.
