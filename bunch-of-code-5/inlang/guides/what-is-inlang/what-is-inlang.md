# What is inlang?

Inlang is globalization infrastructure that powers an ecosystem of apps, plugins, and solutions that make globalization simple.

## Infrastructure approach

For every use case, there is an app, a plugin, a lint rule, or a custom solution that can be built. Inlang's infrastructure powers an ecosystem of tools, applications, best practices, and automationsÂ for organizations to go global.

## Version control and automation via CI/CD

Inlang apps are built on lix. Lix is a git-compatible version control backend for applications. Using lix provides inlang with CI/CD for globalization and collaboration between developers, translators, and designers on one common source of truth: your repository and your data.

## Architecture

Inlang's architecture consists of four main components:

1. [Applications](/documentation/concept/app) - Provide users with an interface for their projects.
2. [SDK](/documentation) - Can be used by developers to build inlang apps.
3. [Project file](/g/49fn9ggo/guide-niklasbuchfink-howToSetupInlang#create-project-file) - Defines the project's settings, which language tags exists and to be imported modules.
4. [Modules](/documentation/plugin) - Contain [plugins](/c/plugins) and/or [lint rules](/c/lint-rules) that define the behavior of a [project](/documentation/concept/project).
