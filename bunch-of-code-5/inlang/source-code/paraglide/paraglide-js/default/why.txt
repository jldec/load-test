Paraglide is a CLI at it's heart & therefore doesn't have a real JS entry point. This 
means that NPM doesn't show the TS icon on the package, which may lead people to believe
it's not typesafe. To sidestep this we added an empty export. We don't think this is dishonest,
because both paraglide's source code and it's output are fully typed.
