# Lix 

Lix is a change control backend for web apps.

Using lix as a backend unlocks automatic change control, distributed collaboration, and automation without cloud complexity like auth, data protection, and integrations.  

**What is a change control system?**

A change control system allows tracking, querying, and reviewing changes in arbitrary data structures (not just files unlike a version control system). For example, a change control system can track changes in a `.sqlite` database, PowerPoint `.pptx`, `.inlang` project, or any other file format you can imagine.

Examples of great lix apps have an "edit > review > automate" workflow:

- document editors (markdown, PDF, etc.)
- accounting solutions (auditing)
- content creation tools (Figma, Adobe Premiere)
- spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)
- CAD software (Fusion 360, Autodesk)
- data science analyzation (Jupyter Notebooks)
