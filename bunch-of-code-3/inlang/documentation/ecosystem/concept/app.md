# App

An inlang app provides a user interface for a [project](/documentation/concept/project). That can be a frontend, a CLI tool or even just an API. Under the hood they load a inlang project to handle your localization data. A wide variety of apps for many different use-cases exists. Go to the [marketplace](/c/apps) to find apps that fit your needs.
