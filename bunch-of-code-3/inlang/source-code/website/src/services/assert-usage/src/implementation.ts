/**
 * Asserts a condition in development environment.
 *
 * Use `assertUsage` to verify the correct usage of code by other developers.
 * Similar to Node.js assert and Dart's https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#assert.
 * If the condition is false, an error is thrown during development. In production,
 * assert calls are removed and, therefore, have no performance error error implication.
 *
 * @example
 *  function x(argument: string){
 *   assertUsage(argument.startsWith("hello"), "The argument must start with 'hello'. Otherwise, the function crashes.")
 *  }
