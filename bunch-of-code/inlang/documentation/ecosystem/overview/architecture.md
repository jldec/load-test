# Architecture

Inlang's architecture consists of three main components:

1. [inlang Apps](/documentation/concept/app) - Provide users with an interface for their projects.
2. [SDK](/documentation/sdk) - Can be used by developers to build inlang apps.
3. [Repository (Lix)](/#lix) - Defines the project's settings, which language tags exists and to be imported modules.
