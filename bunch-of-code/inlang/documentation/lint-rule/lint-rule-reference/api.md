# Lint Rule API

## Meta information
In order to effectively showcase our product in the marketplace and during installation, it is crucial to include the meta information. 

### id 
``messageLintRule.${string}.${string}`` `required`

Unique id of module. Consists of type (messageLintRule), author and name.

```ts
// Example
id: "messageLintRule.inlang.missingTranslation" 
```

### displayName 
`Record<LanguageTag, string>` `required`
The name that is displayed in the marketplace. The name will be localized in the future that's why there is the [languageTag](/documentation/concept/language-tag). For now `en` is fine.

```ts
// Example
displayName: { en: "Lint Rule Name" }
```

### description
`Record<LanguageTag, string>` `required`
The description that is displayed in the marketplace. It will be localized in the future that's why there is the languageTag. For now `en` is fine.

```ts
// Example
description: { en: "This is the Lint Rule description" }
```

## Lint Logic
Where you define and execute your custom linting logic, analyzing message variants and reporting issues as needed.

### message
`function` 

This function named `message` receives a message along with additional contextual information, such as `languageTags`, `sourceLanguageTag`, and a `report` callback.

```ts
	message: (args: {
		message: Message
		settings: ProjectSettings & ExternalSettings
		report: (args: {
			messageId: Message["id"]
			languageTag: LanguageTag
			body: MessageLintReport["body"]
		}) => void
	}) => MaybePromise<void>
```
