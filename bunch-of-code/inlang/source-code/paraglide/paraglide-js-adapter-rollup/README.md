# Paraglide Adapter Rollup

This package provides a Rollup plugin to make it easier to use the paraglide-js.

It automatically runs the compiler on build, removing the
need for the `paraglide` commands in your `package.json`.

## Usage
After having set up paraglide-js, you can add this plugin to your rollup config.

```js
// rollup.config.js
import { paraglide } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-rollup"
export default {
	plugins: [
		paraglide({
			project: "./project.inlang", //Path to your inlang project
			outDir: "./src/paraglide", //Where you want the generated files to be placed
		}),
	]
}
```

Now, the `paraglide` folder at `./src/paraglide` will be automatically updated when you build your project. If you combine this with a watcher, you can rebuild your project whenever you change your messages.

### Setting up an Alias

Since you'll be importing from the `paraglide` folder a lot, it's a good idea to set up an alias for it. This way you won't have to write `../../paraglide` all the time.


You can do this using the `@rollup/plugin-alias` plugin. Install it:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @rollup/plugin-alias
```

And then add it to your rollup config. This example assumes that you're using ESM.

```js
// rollup.config.js
import { paraglide } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-rollup"
import alias from "@rollup/plugin-alias"
import { fileURLToPath } from "url"

export default {
	plugins: [
		alias({
			entries: {
				// This is the alias you can use in your code
				// you can change it to whatever you want
				$paraglide: fileURLToPath(new URL("./src/paraglide", import.meta.url))
			}
		}),
		paraglide({
			project: "./project.inlang",
			outdir: "./src/paraglide",
		}),
	],
}
```

You can now import your messages from `$paraglide/messages`. But typescript will warn that it can't find the module. To fix this, you need to add the alias to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"paths": {
			"$paraglide/*": ["src/paraglide/*"]
		}
	}
}
```

Happy Hacking.
