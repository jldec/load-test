If you've never heard of localization strategy before, don't worry, we'll explain it to you. Localization strategy is the process of adapting a product or content to a specific locale or market. It involves more than just translation (See the difference in detail [here](https://www.smartling.com/resources/101/how-is-translation-different-from-localization/)); it aims to create an authentic and resonant experience for local audiences

## What Is a Localization Strategy?

A localization strategy is a company’s overall plan and approach to adapting its content, offerings, and messaging in new countries. This means addressing the differences in language, culture, customer behavior, and social norms. Big players that have already done that with massive success is [Netflix](https://netflix.com), [WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org) or [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com). By coming up with a localization strategy, you’ll be able to shine a new light on your services in various markets based on data derived from extensive research. You’ll be able to present a more personalized marketing experience to consumers in those areas, showcasing your product or service in a way that this new audience can connect with.

In this example, a SaaS tool is making use of inlang's products to localize their website and achieve a successful localization strategy.
The [IDE Extension](/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension) enables translating the content of the web application. Therefore, the developer can connect a wide range of libraries. The most common one in inlang's ecosystem is [Paraglide JS](/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs), which runs with every popular framework. 

The [CLI for automation](/m/2qj2w8pu/app-inlang-cli) enables the developer to automate the translation process, e.g. with [Machine Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation). The CLI can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to automatically translate the content of the web application.

To make sure that the translation is correct, the [Fink - Message Editor](/m/tdozzpar/app-inlang-finkLocalizationEditor) can be used to send the translation to a professional translator. The translator can then use it to translate the content on one single source of truth. The translation is then automatically pushed to the web application.

Furthermore, and of course in a later stage, it is recommended to watch audits and analytics to see how the localization strategy is performing. This can be done with [GlobeLens](/m/92fst3wd/app-inlang-globelens). Furthermore, at this stage it is not only important that translations are correct, but also that they are optimized for the target market and do not contain any cultural faux pas or other mistakes that could damage the brand image or end in a lawsuit. Herefore, inlang LocalSuits (which is not yet released and just a placeholder) can be used to arrange a legal review of the global content.
