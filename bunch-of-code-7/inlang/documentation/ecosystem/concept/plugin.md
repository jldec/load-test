# Plugin

An inlang plugin defines and extend how an inlang app should behave.

For example, plugin A defines that [messages](/documentation/concept/message) should be stored in a database, while plugin B defines that messages should be stored in a file. An [inlang app](/documentation/concept/app) that uses plugin A will store messages in a database, while an inlang app that uses plugin B will store messages in a file.
